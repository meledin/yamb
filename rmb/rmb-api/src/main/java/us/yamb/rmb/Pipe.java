 * message bus, and is used for a shorthand instead of building identical Send
 * messages.
 * <p>
 * Implementations may optimise a Pipe under the hood, knowing that a
 * significant number of messages will be sent with the same parameters. Thus,
 * if it is expected that many messages will be sent with the same parameters, a
 * Pipe should be built.
